External dependencies:
 
- Boost MPL, Fusion, Smart Pointer, and Type Traits.
- Boost Python and Test (optional - needed for Python support and tests).
- SCons (optional - needed to build non-header-only components).
- M4 (optional - needed to regenerate some header files).
- Eigen 2 (optional)
- FFTW 3 (optional)
- levmar (optional)

The core ndarray library is a header-only library; you can start using it
simply by putting the "include" subfolder in your compile-time
include path.  The headers built by M4 should already be built in any SVN
checkout or release tarball.

For a complete install, simply run

scons install

and then recursively copy the contents of the top-level 'install' and 'lib'
folders to your preferred include and library locations.  For more control
over the build, see

scons --help

for more information.
