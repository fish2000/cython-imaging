The ndarray core library and python support modules are
 available under the liberal "BSD-like" license below.  
However, some optional components depend on 3rd-party libraries
with more restrictive open-source licenses:

eigen2 (ndarray/eigen*) - LGPLv3 or GPLv2
FFTW (ndarray/fft*) - GPLv2+
levmar (ndarray/levmar*) - GPLv2

These components of ndarray are available under any GPL or LGPL
license compatible with the license of the 3rd-party party they
provide an ndarray interface to.
